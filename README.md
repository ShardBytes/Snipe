      * **v1.0** - first color theme with pretty bad colors for Java
      * **v2.0** - fields and methods look now more pleasing, reconfigured to work with setting inheritance, configured Kotlin
      * **v3.0** - added SECTION, FIELDS and METHODS comment highlighting (works same as //TODO) which are used to mark and divide the code so its easier to read
